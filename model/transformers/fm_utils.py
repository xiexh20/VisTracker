    copied from pytorch
    Computes scaled dot product attention on query, key and value tensors, using
    an optional attention mask if passed, and applying dropout if a probability
    greater than 0.0 is specified.
    Returns a tensor pair containing attended values and attention weights.

    Args:
        q, k, v: query, key and value tensors. See Shape section for shape details.
        attn_mask: optional tensor containing mask values to be added to calculated
            attention. May be 2D or 3D; see Shape section for details.
        dropout_p: dropout probability. If greater than 0.0, dropout is applied.

    Shape:
        - q: :math:`(B, Nt, E)` where B is batch size, Nt is the target sequence length,
            and E is embedding dimension.
        - key: :math:`(B, Ns, E)` where B is batch size, Ns is the source sequence length,
            and E is embedding dimension.
        - value: :math:`(B, Ns, E)` where B is batch size, Ns is the source sequence length,
            and E is embedding dimension.
        - attn_mask: either a 3D tensor of shape :math:`(B, Nt, Ns)` or a 2D tensor of
            shape :math:`(Nt, Ns)`.

        - Output: attention values have shape :math:`(B, Nt, E)`; attention weights
            have shape :math:`(B, Nt, Ns)`
