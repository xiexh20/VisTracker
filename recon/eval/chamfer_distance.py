    ----------
    x: numpy array [n_points_x, n_dims]
        first point cloud
    y: numpy array [n_points_y, n_dims]
        second point cloud
    metric: string or callable, default l2
        metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.
    direction: str
        direction of Chamfer distance.
            'y_to_x':  computes average minimal distance from every point in y to x
            'x_to_y':  computes average minimal distance from every point in x to y
